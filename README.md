# Data_Cleaning

Data set is preprocessed before doing dimentionality reduction and finally training the dataset on some model to predict the results with accuracy


1. First we check for the number of null values in the dataset

2. Depending on the number of null values the next step is decided
3. Other inappropriate values are changed to NAN and finally replaced by the median of the corresponding attribute
